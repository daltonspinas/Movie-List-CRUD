# Movie-List-CRUD

**The database for this project is currently down due to a subscription billing conflict I had with Microsoft**

This is a CRUD app which I built using .NET on the back-end and Angular on the front-end. My first time using either technology. 
The purpose of this app is to make API calls to a movie database to view and search for movies. Once you have found a movie you can add it to a list you have created.
You can perform all of the expected CRUD operations with your movie lists. You can create a list, rename it, and add/delete movies from it.


To see the app in action please go to: http://daltons-movie-list-app.herokuapp.com/
(please be respectful as everyone who visits after you will see the same lists)

To run locally, run "ng serve -o" from within the "Movie-Frontend" folder.
